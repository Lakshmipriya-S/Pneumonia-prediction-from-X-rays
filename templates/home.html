     Just imagine the damage our body will have to face when your lungs is infected, making it hard to breathe. 
     
     Pneumonia is one such infection that inflames the air sacs, alveoli, of your lungs. The air sacs may fill up with fluid or pus, causing symptoms such as a cough, fever, chills, trouble breathing, chest pain, loss of appetite, Nausea and vomiting.</p>
     
     
     <p>
     
     The Bacteria, Fungus or the Virus which causes pneumonia are contagious, which means it can spread from one person to another. 
     
     You can identify, the presence of the pneumonia - Lung infection , through the following diagnostic test’s such as:
     </p>
     
     <ul>
         <li><img src="/static/Image/bloodcircle.png" alt="blood test" style=height:200px width:200px> &nbsp; A Simple blood test for pneumonia can help limit use of antibiotics</li><br><br>
         <li><img src="/static/Image/xraycircle.png" alt="Chest X-Ray’s" style=height:200px width:200px> &nbsp; An X-ray will help looking for white spots in the lungs (called infiltrates) that identify an infection</li><br><br>
         <li><img src="/static/Image/sputumcircle.png" alt="Sputum test" style=height:200px width:200px> &nbsp; Sputum, also known as phlegm, is a thick type of mucus made in the lungs and finds out infection in lungs or airwayds leading to lungs.</li><br><br>
         <li><img src="/static/Image/ctscancircle.png" alt="CT Scan" style=height:200px width:200px> &nbsp; A chest CT scan to obtain a more detailed image of your lungs, that looks for infections.</li><br><br>
         <li><img src="/static/Image/bronchoscopycircle.png" alt="Bronchoscopy" style=height:200px width:200px> &nbsp; Bronchoscopy is a procedure to look directly at the airways in the lungs using a thin, lighted tube (bronchoscope).</li><br>
     </ul>
     <p>
     Thus, this idea for the project is in aim to help the people detect the presence of pneumonia, well ahead of the stages rather than getting them delayed for the treatment. 
     
     All you need to do is, upload the image of your Lung’s X-Ray, and you will be able to predict, if the X-ray is from a healthy person or if the person is affected by Pneumonia. The model created gives 96% accuracy in prediction.
